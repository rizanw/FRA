# FRA

a front-end web development (fully CSS and HTML only) to join [FutureReady ASEAN Competition](https://www.futurereadyasean.org/).

Blog Description:
Welcome to our blog, terrennial. We at terrennial are trying to further spread awareness about our changing climate and some sustainable solution for that. Wrapped in a way of interesting, fresh visuals, terrennial is an experience you will make sure not to miss. Don't forget to tell your friends!

Note :  
actually we are also trying to implementing javascript on our code to make the darkmode running without duplicating HTML file, just like based on Digital Citizen Course. But it is forbidden to include javascript (HTML and CSS only are allowed). So we store it [here](https://github.com/rizanw/FRA-terrennial/tree/new-theme-js).
